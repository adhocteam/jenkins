## Summary

One paragraph explanation.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What does it solve? What is the expected outcome?

## Guide-level explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the architecture and you were teaching it to another team member. That generally means:

- Introducing new concepts.
- Explaining it largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how team members should think about it, and how it should impact the way they work/code/operate our services. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- Try to liberally use graphics here to illustrate the concepts, the current state, and the “to be” state.

## Reference-level explanation

This is the technical portion of proposal. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other components is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how it could/should/would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.
- How can we test the proposed change before rolling it out to production?
- Once in production how will we monitor and observe it to be sure it is working correctly? If it’s not working correctly, how will we alert? What remediation steps can we take (e.g, if a node fails)?

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

Graphics are highly encouraged here such as detailed architectural diagrams, network flow charts, etc.

## Drawbacks

Why should we not do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this exist in other architectures/projects at Ad Hoc and what experience have they had?
- What lessons can we learn from what other teams have done here? Open source projects, companies, etc.
- Are there any published papers or great blog posts that discuss this?
  This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other places to provide the readers with a fuller picture.

## Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this approach?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this proposal that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this?

## Future possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the system in a holistic way. Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap/priorities for the team.
This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for this proposal but otherwise related.
If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.
